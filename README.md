# Agentic AI ResearcherðŸ¤–ðŸ“„

**An AIâ€‘powered research assistant that fetches, summarizes, and analyzes arXiv papers using LangGraph. Supports reading existing PDFs and exporting summaries to PDF via Tectonic.**

---

## âœ¨Key Features

* **arXiv Integration** â€“ Search and retrieve academic papers by title, author, abstract, or unique identifier (arXiv ID).
* **Smart Summaries** â€“ Generate concise, high-quality summaries to distill key insights.
* **PDF Input Support** â€“ Use `read_pdf.py` to ingest and process PDFs directly in the pipeline.
* **PDF Output via Tectonic** â€“ Export polished summaries in PDF format using Tectonic for professional presentation.
* **Streamlit Interface** â€“ (Assuming you use it based on topics) Offers an interactive UI for real-time querying and quick access to research content.

## Getting Started

### ðŸš€ Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Optional: Tectonic installed or `tectonic.exe` included for PDF generation
* API access as needed (e.g., LangGraph API credentials, if applicable)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhaySingh71/Agentic-AI-Researcher.git
cd Agentic-AI-Researcher
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For Tectonic, if not bundled, ensure:

* **macOS/Linux**: `tectonic` is installed and available in your PATH
* **Windows**: Include `tectonic.exe` in the project root or provide its path

## ðŸ›  Usage Guide

### 1. Fetch & Summarize from arXiv

```bash
python ai_researcher_langgraph.py --query "transformer networks" --summarize
```

This will:

* Fetch relevant arXiv papers (using `arxiv_tool.py`)
* Summarize them via summary logic in `ai_researcher_langgraph.py`
* Display or save to console (depending on your implementation)

### 2. Read and Process Local PDFs

```bash
python read_pdf.py --file path/to/paper.pdf --summarize
```

This leverages PDF parsing followed by summary generation. Works with both arXiv and external PDFs.

### 3. Export Summary to PDF via Tectonic

```bash
python write_pdf.py --input summary.md --output summary.pdf
```

Use this to convert your **Markdown summaries** into well-formatted PDFs using Tectonic.

### 4. (Optional) Launch the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run frontend.py
```

Enjoy a user-friendly interface for:

* Searching arXiv
* Viewing paper abstracts and summaries
* Uploading PDFs
* Exporting summaries with a click

## Architecture Overview

1. **arXiv Fetching** â€” Querying arXiv and retrieving raw metadata or PDFs (`arxiv_tool.py`)
2. **LangGraph Orchestration** â€” Pipelines managing fetch â†’ summarize â†’ format (`ai_researcher_langgraph.py`)
3. **PDF Parsing (read\_pdf.py)** â€” Extracts text from PDFs to feed into summarizer
4. **PDF Rendering (write\_pdf.py + Tectonic)** â€” Converts Markdown outputs to PDF with high-quality typesetting
5. **Frontend (frontend.py)** â€” Optional interactive UI layer for end-user interaction

---

## Why It Matters

* **Speeds up literature review workflows**
* **Handles both remote (arXiv) and local sources**
* **Generates clean, professional PDFs for sharing**
* **Built with modular structure for easy extension**

---

## Future Enhancements

* **Citation Export** (e.g., BibTeX, RIS)
* **Fullâ€‘text PDF generation** (beyond summaries, for note aggregations)
* **Keyword filters and semantic search**
* **Multiâ€‘language or domainâ€‘adaptive summarization**
* **Collaborative workspace or teamâ€‘share deployment**
